<div class="larger">

I am a website **developer** and **designer** with experience in captivating visual design, creative thinking & effective solutions, solid **strategies** & architecture, and easy-to-follow user experience. 

My primary expertise is in **Drupal** development. Apart from this, I have experience with WordPress, CodeIgniter, and various PHP frameworks. I have worked projects running the gamut from brochureware to e-Commerce websites and **enterprise** non-profit fundraising platforms; many have included both aesthetic and application design.
 
I have worked on the web for 10 years. I founded my first web development business, [visuaLATT&Eacute;](http://www.visualatte.com/), in 2008, and sold it in 2014. Until recently, I have worked as a Manager of Website Development at [Jackson River](http://www.jacksonriver.com/).
