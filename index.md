If you are looking for a website **developer** and **designer** with experience in captivating visual design, creative thinking & effective solutions, and solid **strategies** & architecture, you've come to the right place.

My primary expertise is in **Drupal** development. Apart from this, I have experience with WordPress, CodeIgniter, and various PHP frameworks. I have worked projects running the gamut from brochureware to e-Commerce websites and **enterprise** nonprofit fundraising platforms; many have included both aesthetic and application design.
 
A serial entrepreneur of sorts, I have been in business&mdash;in one form or another&mdash;since middle school, and have worked on the web for over 10 years. Currently, I am a partner and developer at [Congruity Works](http://congruity.works/). I have also worked as a development manager at [Jackson River](http://www.jacksonriver.com/) and have spent six years running a previous business, [visuaLATT&Eacute;](http://www.visualatte.com/).
